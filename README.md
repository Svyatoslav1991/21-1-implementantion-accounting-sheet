# 21-1-implementantion-accounting-sheet

You have already created a program for reading and writing the bill. Now it will have to be generalized and supplemented with the use of structures.

The format of the statement is the same: first comes the name and surname of the recipient of funds, then the date of issue in the format DD.MM.YYYY, then the amount of payment in rubles. The data is separated by spaces. There must be a line feed at the end of each entry.

The data structure of the entry must conform to the specified format.

When starting the program, the user specifies the command to be executed: list or add. The list command reads from the list file, as before, only into data structures, and displays them on the screen.

The add command adds a new entry to the end of the list.
